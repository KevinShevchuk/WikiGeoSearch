# WikiGeoSearch
Android application that uses location data to search for Wikipedia articles geo-tagged to be near the user.

Contains both the ability to view locations as pins on a Maps windows as well as a list with distances and coordinates. Toggling
between them can be done through the action bar.

NOTE: Wikipedia's API restricts the number of results returned from the Geosearch to 10. I know of no way to circumvent this.
